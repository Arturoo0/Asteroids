# Asteroids
Asteroids like clone made with Pygame. 

- Ideally run with Python 3.7.7 or greater https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#:~:text=Pygame%20requires%20Python%3B%20if%20you,python%20uses%20to%20install%20packages).
- With Pygame installed 'python3 main.py' or any equivalent run command should have the game loading.

TODO

- Asteroid split on collision
